        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Marketing ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current business student at the University of California, Riverside. I am pursuing business marketing due to my passion for design and creative nature. In the 
        future, I hope to be a marketing specialist for a company, promoting products and furthering a company's branding.
        My experience in designing posters and social media posts to promote events and ideas has allowed me to learn what designs appeal to people and what draws them in. Also, being able to use both Adobe Illustrator
        and Photoshop has allowed me to gain various tools to achieve different design styles and goals. By designing promotions on different formats, I learned how to adjust designs in a way
        that they would be most successful for the given format. This allowed me to experiment with different colors, layouts, fonts, and sizes to create a cohesive and attractive end result. Additionally, designing
        for a variety of events has given me experience in utilizing different color stories and shapes that best match the specific event. <br><br>

        I have a passion for helping others be the best that they can be, and my experience as a tutor has allowed me to do so. Through working in both one-on-one and group settings,
        I have learned how to adapt to different situations and scenarios. Additionally, using different learning styles for different students has allowed me to 
        problem solve and figure out a path to success for each individual. Tutoring various students allowed me to develop leadership as well as communication skills because
        not only did I have to learn how to communicate to students, but I had to listen to them in order to figure out how to best help them to be successful. Furthermore, each individual 
        is different, so each way of communication is different, causing me to learn how to communicate and listen in different ways.<br><br>

        My experience as a club leader has allowed me to involve myself in a meaningful project and gain leadership skills. The Wounded Warriors Project seeks to raise awareness for our troops
        overseas, and during club meetings I would teach students the importance of giving back. By holding monthly club meetings, I learned presentation skills such as informing students in an 
        interesting way. In addition, I was able to come up with creative activities that allowed students to give back, such as writing a card to a soldier. Another thing I learned in my experience 
        as a club leader was to communicate with other staff in order to set up various events. Not only did I have to complete paperwork, but I had to pitch my ideas to certain people. Due to this,
        I learned how to defend my ideas and follow through with my plans. Since I held various fundraising events, I learned how to set them up, how to draw people in to them, and how to assign volunteers
        to different tasks. In this club, I not only learned how to lead the club members, but I learned how to work together with the club staff. When the club staff had ideas and feedback,
        I learned to listen and consider each thought and idea.
